# Optimal-Unilateral-Carbon-Policy-Yale
This is the project I worked on for Professor Samuel Kortum, Yale as a pre-doc fellow during 2024-25

In this paper **Kortum and Weisbach ** derive a stylized general-equilibrium model of trade and carbon externalities to derive a coalition’s optimal Pareto-improving policy in such an environment.
It can be implemented through: (i) a tax on fossil-fuel extraction at a rate equal to the global marginal harm from carbon emissions, (ii) a tax on imports of energy and goods, and a rebate of the tax on exports of energy but not goods, all at a lower rate per unit of carbon than the extraction tax rate, and (iii) a goods-specific export subsidy. This combination of taxes and subsidies exploits international trade to expand the policy’s reach.

My responsibilities involved:
1. Finishing drafting the code to calibrate, estimate and simulate the carbon policy under various tax regimes in the paper. **(PYTHON)**
2. Parallelization of the code.  **(PYTHON)**
3. Builiding the final figures and tables in the paper.  **(PYTHON)**

Note I took over part of coding (1) from the previous pre-doc.
